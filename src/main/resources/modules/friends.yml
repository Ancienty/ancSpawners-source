friends:
  # Friends module allows players to add 'friends' to their spawners, who
  # are then allowed to access storage of the spawner, sell items from the
  # storage, take items from the storage, etc. (basically have access to
  # all features of the spawner) friends can't: break the spawner, add other friends.
  # For a player to add friends to their spawners, they need the permission
  # written below.
