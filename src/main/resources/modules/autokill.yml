auto-kill:
  # Auto-kill is a togglable feature, you can enable/disable it through
  # the main menu of the spawners. Auto-kill is basically when a spawner
  # spawns a mob, the mob dies instantly and it's drops are added to the
  # spawner's storage, for a player to be able to enable this feature they
  # need the permission written below.
  # ** ONLY THE SPAWNER'S OWNER CAN TOGGLE THIS FEATURE.
  # ** !!! TO BE ABLE TO USE AUTO-KILL ON A SPAWNER, YOU *MUST* HAVE A
  # VALID LOOTTABLE FILE CREATED FOR THAT MOB! !!!
  enabled: true
  # Forcing auto-kill means that all spawners will have auto-kill enabled and
  # players will not be able to turn auto-kill off. Forcing auto-kill does NOT check
  # for permissions, so auto-kill will be enabled for everyone.
  # Default: false
  force: false
  # Only force custom loottables on entities that were killed by the
  # autokill module, the entities that were killed by players won't drop
  # the items specified in the custom loottable if this is true.
