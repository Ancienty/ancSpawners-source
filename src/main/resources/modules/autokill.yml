auto-kill:
  # The auto-kill feature lets the spawner automatically kill newly spawned mobs
  # and store their drops internally. This removes the need for players to manually
  # kill these mobs. Players can toggle this feature on or off from the spawner’s
  # main menu, but only if they have the required permission (see below).
  # IMPORTANT: Only the spawner’s owner can toggle this feature.
  enabled: true

  # When forced, auto-kill will be active on all spawners at all times, without the
  # option for players to turn it off. This setting bypasses any permission checks,
  # making auto-kill universally enabled.
  # Default: false
  force: false

  # If enabled, custom loottables will only apply to mobs killed by the auto-kill
  # feature. Any mobs that are killed by players instead of auto-kill will use their
  # normal drops, ignoring custom loottables.
  loottable-only-autokill: true

  # Players need this permission to toggle the auto-kill feature on their spawners.
  permission: ancspawners.autokill
