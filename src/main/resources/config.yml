spawners:
  # This section defines the configuration for different types of spawners.
  # "default" applies to all spawners and acts as a fallback.
  # Any mob/entity that does not have its own entry will use these values.
  #
  # To create a unique configuration for a specific spawner type:
  # 1. Copy the entire "default" section.
  # 2. Paste it below and rename "default" to your new spawner name (e.g. "zombie" or "iron").
  # 3. Adjust "material" and other values to match the mob/item you want.

  default:
    # The name format of the spawner when viewed in-game.
    # {entity_name} is replaced by the entityâ€™s name.
