# This is an example loottable,
# A loottable is like a possible drops list for mobs, and below you can
# add and modify every item you might want zombies to drop.
# Because this is an example loottable, it will not change anything.
# To create your own loottables, just create a file named 'name_of_the_mob.yml'
# and edit accordingly:

drops:
  # Item drop lists, edit to your liking.
  # format:
  # 'item:chance:range'
  # Range means the range of the amount of items that
  # could be dropped.
  itemDrops:
    - ROTTEN_FLESH:70:1-3
    - GOLD_INGOT:10:1-1

  # XP drops for zombies, can only be used as range.
  xpDrops: 1-15
  xpDropChance: 100
