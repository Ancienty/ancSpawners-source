# This file defines a loottable for a specific mob (in this case, an example for zombies).
# Loottables determine what items and XP the mob can drop when killed by auto-kill.
# To create your own, simply make a file named after the mobâ€™s type (e.g., "zombie.yml")
# and edit the drops below.

drops:
  # Item drop configuration:
  # Format: 'ITEM:CHANCE:POSSIBLE_AMOUNT_RANGE'
  # - ITEM: The material ID of the dropped item.
  # - CHANCE: The percentage (0-100) that this item will drop.
  # - RANGE: The range of possible dropped item quantities (e.g., "1-3" means between 1 and 3 items).
  itemDrops:
    - ROTTEN_FLESH:70:1-3
    - GOLD_INGOT:10:1-1

  # XP drops configuration:
